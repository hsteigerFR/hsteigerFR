ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hsteigerFR

âž¤ I am an engineering student at Ecole des Mines de Nancy (FR), in the Computer Science Department. I am currently attending my last academic year : my 6-month end of study internship is taking place at the Signal Image Speech department of the Gendarmerie Nationale Criminal Research Institute (IRCGN).

âž¤ Fond of the potential positive impact of the following technological sectors, I would like to use my advanced skills in Data Science / AI and knowledge in Cybersecurity to participate in the improvement of society for all, both of these sectors being of concern as regards today Computer Science challenges. Law enforcement support is currently my main area of focus.

âž¤ I am a purposeful worker who can quickly learn new knowledge and skills. Within a continuous improvement framework, I am getting familiar with new Data Science and Data Engineering state-of-the-art tools. Computer Vision is my specialty, but I'm also presently learning NLP.
